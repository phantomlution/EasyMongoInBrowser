# Why have this project
This is a project for the person who want to make his own toolkit in browser-like environment(Somewhere he/she can use Javascript).

1. Maybe you want to manipulate database directly in browser.
2. Maybe you are bored with the almost-same CRUD code in the server.

So, this project provide a simple solution. a simple wrapper for the mongo api.
And expose interface for client-side

## Something you should know before using this project.
Because we expose database interface to the browser directly, there are some safe issues.
As I have mentioned, this project is aimed for the person who want to make his/her own toolkit in browser like environment.

How to solve this problem:
You can use RSA encryption to encrypt all of your request and response(This feature is coming soon after the main function are ready)

## Others
The first version will be written in python.
But maybe i will rewrite the code with VERT.X 4.0.

Anyone who is interested in making personal toolkit in Javascript. please leave a issue in this project.

## Let's make personal application development easier.
